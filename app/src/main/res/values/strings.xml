        <item>Remind me that I must die, so I grow wise.</item>
        <item>Don\'t regret growing older. Its a privilege denied to many.</item>
        <item>Live simply so that others may simply live.</item>
        <item>Death is something inevitable. When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace.</item>
        <item>On the contrary, death is the ultimate fairness; rich and poor, young and old, all are equal in death.</item>
        <item>The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.</item>
        <item>Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That\'s why it\'s called the present.</item>
        <item>Being sad with the right people is better than being happy with the wrong ones.</item>
        <item>You have enemies? Good. That means you\'ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.</item>
        <item>You are only young once, but you can be immature forever.</item>
        <item>Worrying is like a rocking chair: it gives you something to do, but doesn\'t get you anywhere.</item>
        <item>When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help.</item>
        <item>Don\'t fear failure. - Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.</item>
        <item>Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.</item>
        <item>Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.</item>
